# Starter transformation

[This code sample](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/develop/python/destinations/starter_destination) demonstrates how to consume data from a Kafka topic, perform an operation on that data, then persist or publish that data to an external destination.

The simple boilerplate code consumes to data from the source topic, prints the content to console output and publishes to any destination based on code that that you must add yourself.

To use the sample, first modify the Python code to publish to your chosen destination(s).
