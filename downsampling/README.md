# Starter transformation

[This code sample](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/develop/python/transformations/starter_transformation) demonstrates how to consume data from a topic, apply a simple transformation to that data and publish the result to an output topic (while printing content to the console output).

Modify the Python code to transform your data on the fly.
